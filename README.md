# CR3DesignCo – Custom 3D Printed Vases, Sculptures & Prototypes

CR3DesignCo is my independently operated 3D printing brand specializing in modern vases, sculptures, functional art, and one-off prototypes. I handle everything from CAD design to final print and shipping — using a custom FDM printer farm I’ve personally built and maintained.

## 💡 My Role

I built CR3DesignCo as both a creative outlet and a small-batch business. Everything is done by hand — from CAD modeling and slicing to machine calibration and post-processing. I also manage the Etsy storefront, listings, branding, and customer comms.
